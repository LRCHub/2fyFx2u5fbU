I like
Television sets

I like
Television sets
Because they have voices
For when you are alone

I like
Television sets
With pre-printed kisses
To leave my lips ice-cold

Cathode mamma kiss me
In my cable paradise
Cathode mamma kiss me
My seven-channel wife

I like
Television sets
They fill my empty rooms
With electronic stone

I like
Television sets
Because they don't hit back
When you turn them off

Cathode mamma kiss me
In my cable paradise
Cathode mamma kiss me
My seven-channel wife

I like
Television sets
They never go to sleep
But glitter through the night

I like
Television sets
They always stay at home
And keep my bed so warm

Cathode mamma kiss me
In my cable paradise
Cathode mamma kiss me
My seven-channel wife

I like
Television sets
When they borrow pictures
From their video friends

I like
Television sets
I like
Television sets
I like
Television sets
I like
Television sets

I like
Television sets
I like
Television sets
I like
Television sets
I like
Television sets
